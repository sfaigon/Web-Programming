    <h2>Why I took this class</h2>
    <p>&emsp;<span>Web programming </span>unlike the other classes that I have taken seems completely new to me. I wanted to expand my knowledge to learn a new skill which this class is definetely allowing me too. Just looking at the curriculum in the beginning of the class kind of scared me with all the new concepts that I would be trying to tackle but it is going well. I am sure that this class will allow me to add alot more to my resume in comparison to what I have now.</p>

 <h2> A Little About Me</h2>
    <p> &emsp;I was born in California but I moved to Georgia shortly after. My family lived with my uncle for a couple years until we finally bought a house and settled down in lawrenceville. My two favorite hobbies would be <a href="https://georgiawildlife.com/fishing/angler-resources"> fishing </a> and <a href="https://georgiawildlife.com/hunting/hunter-resources"> hunting </a>. I am much more of an outdoor person in comparison to the typical <span>computer science</span> stereotype. </p>
